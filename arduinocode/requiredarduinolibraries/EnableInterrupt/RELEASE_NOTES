Version 0.5 (Alpha) of the library has been released. This release includes support for the ATmega1284p line of processors (includes ATmega644). The Mighty 1284 is used as the basis.  As I don't have a 1284-based processor, this code compiles but has not been tested (see examples/Might1284p). Bug reports encouraged and welcomed! It would be great if a 644/1284 owner could upload the Might1284p.ino sketch and interrupt every pin and let me know the results.

Code was refactored so that a lot of utility routines were moved into individual .h files. Now there's a lot of files, which appears ugly, but the old way was a lot uglier to my mind and looked like a big bowl of spaghetti with so many #ifdefs strewn about to handle the different chips. It was getting hard to wade through the code.

Version 0.4 - New high speed ("HiSpeed") mode. In this mode, the interrupt routine is predefined:
it ONLY updates a variable. This knocks a couple of microseconds off of the interrupt
routine times; it greatly reduces the number of registers needed to be pushed/popped, and
of course does not require a function call. See the wiki for details, including speed measurements.

Version 0.3 - Arjun reported a bug on the Uno platform:

In file included from Interrupt.ino:1:
/Users/arjunmehta94/Documents/Arduino/libraries/EnableInterrupt-master/EnableInterrupt.h: In function 'void __vector_3()':
/Users/arjunmehta94/Documents/Arduino/libraries/EnableInterrupt-master/EnableInterrupt.h:976: error: 'struct functionPointersPortB' has no member named 'pinSix'
/Users/arjunmehta94/Documents/Arduino/libraries/EnableInterrupt-master/EnableInterrupt.h:977: error: 'struct functionPointersPortB' has no member named 'pinSeven'

I have a Duemilanove; I don't know why I never saw that error. Regardless, I have included some
#ifndef lines in to protect that code from getting compiled.

Also added RELEASE_NOTES to the zip file, and to Git.
